    "# Brainstorm\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item of business is to **identify a problem to solve or a question to answer** using the tools from class e.g. `matplotlib`, `ipywidgets`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`. This section is designed to help you come up with a project that is interesting to you and aligns with the current unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Top-down\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already have a topic or a dataset in mind that you would like to use for the project. In the top-down approach to project development, you start with an ideal output, then assemble the tools to make it happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some sources you can use to identify datasets you might use for a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make your own! Believe it or not, there is a lot of data you already collect that you might use for a project. Your internet search history, posts to social media, fitbit data, photos, etc. Many of these tools have ways of exporting the data into a useable format for data analysis.\n",
    "* North Carolina State maintains a [list of cool open source databases](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/formats/teaching-and-learning-datasets). You could find something from the public sector like NASA, or the private sector like bike companies. All can make cool projects. Do some digging here to find something cool!\n",
    "* If you want to try something local, check out the datasets maintained by the state of Nevada. There isn't a central portal, but you can try looking up data maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Division of Minerals, the Office of Economic Development, and the Department of Transportation. These may be particularly interesting for geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have identified a dataset, think of what kind of questions you could answer with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bottom-up\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other end of the spectrum, maybe you know the kind of data analysis tools you would like to use, but you don't have a problem or dataset to use them on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start brainstorming project ideas by examining the API, tutorials, or gallery sections of the packages from class:\n",
    "* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index)\n",
    "* [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/reference/index.html)\n",
    "* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc//scipy/reference/index.html)\n",
    "* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html)\n",
    "* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you want to use a more sophisticated version of an algorithm in class, maybe you want to teach yourself a new function or tool. These can be a great way to ground your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "However you choose to start your project, whether with a problem, a dataset, or a tool, they can all be used to demonstrate your growth during the unit.\n",

You can and should skip code, highlighting only the important points that illustrate interesting functions or algorithms, dashboards, and plots.

    "We will develop code from scratch together in class. However, code isn't helpful to you later if you don't carefully annotate it. Have you ever tried to figure out what you-six-months-ago was trying to do on a coding project with good comments? It's a nightmare! Each day after lecture, you should take the time to fill in the notebook with your own explanations. You won't get full credit with one-line comments here and there from class; in the end you want to submit a document that would be readable to someone who hadn't attended lecture, similar in style to a tutorial. It will be helpful to use Markdown to guide the reader through the project, including headers, equations, bullet points, etc. This should be in your own words.\n",

A guide to Latex can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) (note how you can also add hyperlinks to documents!). You can make equations, matrices, integrals, etc. all with Latex.
